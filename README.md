# Disclaimer

Pytim is in **alpha-stage** right now and not all modules have undergone systematic testing, use at your own risk :) In this period, commits with major fixes or introduction of major features will follow relatively frequently, so keep an eye on it if you are interested in using the code.

If you try this software out and have some suggestions, remarks, or bugfixes, feel free to comment here on github and/or make a pull request.

In addition, while at this stage, please note that the interface might change noticeably between commits.

# What is Pytim?

[Pytim](https://marcello-sega.github.io/pytim/) is a cross-platform python implementation of the ITIM and GITIM algorithm for the analysis of fluid interfaces.

Pytim relies on the [MDAnalysis](http://www.mdanalysis.org/)
package for reading/writing trajectories, and work therefore seamlessly for a number of popular trajectory formats, including:  
* GROMACS
* CHARMM/NAMD
* LAMMPS
* AMBER
* DL_Poly

as well as common structure file formats such as XYZ or PDB (have a look at the [complete list](https://pythonhosted.org/MDAnalysis/documentation_pages/coordinates/init.html#id1))


# How to install the package and the documentation? 

1. Make sure you have an up-to-date version of cython, numpy, scipy and MDAnalysis:

``` 
pip install --user --upgrade cython numpy scipy MDAnalysis
```

2. Download and install pytim

```
git clone https://github.com/Marcello-Sega/pytim.git
cd pytim
python setup.py install --user
```

# Trouble installing ? 

Some of the most common issues are the following:

**Problem**: The system does not let me write (even using `sudo`) some files

**Solution**: You're most likely running under a recent version of OS-X. Always install packages as user (`pip install <package> --user`

**Problem**: cKDTree complains about the `boxsize` parameter

**Solution**: the version of `scipy` must be >= 0.18


**Problem**: Even though I've upgraded `scipy`, I keep getting problems about `boxsize`

**Solution**: You should tell python where to find packages by setting the variable `$PYTHONPATH` 

**Problem**: some error message mentioning `... file was built for x86_64 which is not the architecture being linked (i386)`

**Solution**: use `export ARCHFLAGS='-arch x86_64'` before installing




# OK, but what is ITIM / GITIM more in detail?  
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Marcello-Sega/gitim/ITIM/media/soot1small.png" width="180" align="right" style="z-index:999;">
**ITIM** and **GITIM** are two algorithms for the identification
of interfacial molecules or atoms.

ITIM has been designed for planar interfaces while GITIM is free from any geometrical constraints and can
be used to analyze interfacial properties of surfaces with arbitrary
shapes.
